# Kotlin.ScopeFunctions

Use [Kotlin's Scope Functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/scope-functions.html) in .NET

Like LINQ for single values, Scope Functions are a powerful way to write code that is more declarative and reads like the flow of information through your program.

## Installation

The package is available from nuget.org as [Kotlin.ScopeFunctions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kotlin.ScopeFunctions)

Or, you can run `install-package Kotlin.ScopeFunctions` from within your IDE
